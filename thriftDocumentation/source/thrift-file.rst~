Writing a .thrift file
=======================================

In a .thrift file you can define the services that your server will implement and that they will be called by any clients.
The Thrift compiler will read this file and generate source code to be used from the servers and clients you will write.

A simple .thrift file with witch we defined our simple multiplication service for this demo looks like this: ::

	namespace java tutorial
	namespace py tutorial
	
	/*
	 C like comments are supported
	*/	
	// This is also a valid comment

	typedef i32 int // We can use typedef to get pretty names for the types we are using 

	service MultiplicationService
	{
		int multiply(1:int n1, 2:int n2),
	}

In the above file we just define a service to multiply two numbers and return their product to avoid making our first demo hard to undersand.
If you named this file multi.thrift and you want to use java and python all you need to do is to run ::

	thrift --gen java multiplication.thrift
	thrift --gen py multiplication.thrift

Thrift will now generate code for you and place it in the gen-java and gen-py directories respectively. Make sure you have saficient rights to write inside the directory. Otherwise you might need to run the above commands as sudo user. 

* Notice in the above file the namespaces we define. They dictate that Thrift should generate a sub-directory named tutorial inside gen-java and gen-py and place the output files there. We could have specified different namespaces for java and python. We could also ommit specifying a namespace. In the latter case the files would be place directly inside the gen-java and gen-py directories.
* Notice also that we can typedef Thrift types with something more easy to remember (i32 with int in this case)

A more detailed example of how you can specify structs, exceptions and other thrift language constructs inside your definition file is specified on tutorial.thrift file that comes along with your Thrift installation. The file contains descriptive comments and it is self-explanatory. Below we notice its most importand parts.

You can include other .thrift files
###################################

*  Included objects are accessed using the name of the .thrift file as a prefix. i.e. shared.SharedObject ::

	include "shared.thrift"

	
	typedef i32 MyInteger

	/**
	 * Thrift also lets you define constants for use across languages. Complex
	 * types and structs are specified using JSON notation.
	 */
	const i32 INT32CONSTANT = 9853
	const map<string,string> MAPCONSTANT = {'hello':'world', 'goodnight':'moon'}

	/**
	 * You can define enums, which are just 32 bit integers. Values are optional
	 * and start at 1 if not supplied, C style again.
	 */
	enum Operation {
	  ADD = 1,
	  SUBTRACT = 2,
	  MULTIPLY = 3,
	  DIVIDE = 4
	}

	/**
	 * Structs are the basic complex data structures. They are comprised of fields
	 * which each have an integer identifier, a type, a symbolic name, and an
	 * optional default value.
	 *
	 * Fields can be declared "optional", which ensures they will not be included
	 * in the serialized output if they aren't set.  Note that this requires some
	 * manual management in some languages.
	 */
	struct Work {
	  1: i32 num1 = 0,
	  2: i32 num2,
	  3: Operation op,
	  4: optional string comment,
	}

	/**
	 * Structs can also be exceptions, if they are nasty.
	 */
	exception InvalidOperation {
	  1: i32 what,
	  2: string why
	}

	/**
	 * Ahh, now onto the cool part, defining a service. Services just need a name
	 * and can optionally inherit from another service using the extends keyword.
	 */
	service Calculator extends shared.SharedService {

	  /**
	   * A method definition looks like C code. It has a return type, arguments,
	   * and optionally a list of exceptions that it may throw. Note that argument
	   * lists and exception lists are specified using the exact same syntax as
	   * field lists in struct or exception definitions.
	   */

	   void ping(),

	   i32 add(1:i32 num1, 2:i32 num2),

	   i32 calculate(1:i32 logid, 2:Work w) throws (1:InvalidOperation ouch),

	   /**
	    * This method has a oneway modifier. That means the client only makes
	    * a request and does not listen for any response at all. Oneway methods
	    * must be void.
	    */
	   oneway void zip()

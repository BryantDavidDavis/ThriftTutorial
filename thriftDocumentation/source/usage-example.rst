How to use Thrift with examples
=======================================

After creating a .thrift file [+ Add link to thift-file.html here+] you are now ready to run Thrift in order to generate code in your targeted languages. The usage of thrift command is: ::

	thrift [options] file

For example if you want to generate code for java you should type: ::

	thrift -r --gen filame.thrift

The above command will generate a directory gen-java which will contain all the code generated by Thrift in java. The option -r is to specify that we want to generate recursively code for potential includes on our .thrift file.


* Notice: When trying to run the python server you may encounter the error: ::

	ImportError: No module named Thrift

This can be easily fixed by going to the directory lib/py on the thrift installation directory and run the following command to install the thrift module to your python libraries: ::

	sudo python setup.py install
